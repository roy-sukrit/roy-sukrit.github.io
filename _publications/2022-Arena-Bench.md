In this article, I share how I built a system to detect cognitive stress passively ‚Äî without any wearables, sensors, or interrupting the user ‚Äî simply by analyzing how someone interacts with their laptop.

The model leverages keystroke dynamics, mouse movement, and gaze tracking via the built-in webcam to identify signs of stress. One of the breakthroughs was the implementation of gaze detection using head pose estimation and facial landmarks, which led to a 30% improvement in accuracy, especially for users wearing glasses.

The system achieved up to 89% prediction accuracy and was awarded **Best Project - Taught Master‚Äôs** üèÜ.
