👨🏻‍💻 I'm an upcoming Postgraduate Researcher at TUS Athlone, Ireland.

🔬 My research focuses on leveraging Machine Learning to generate synthetic datasets in various digital enhancement domains.

📚 I'm currently working on my Master's thesis in the field of Computer Vision and Stress Detection.

📽️ I'm also interested in AI Agents, LLMs, RAGs, and general Machine Learning applications.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I developed an LED visualizer system — [Arduino LED Visualizer](https://github.com/roy-sukrit/Arduino-LED-Piano) — which syncs with piano notes and generates color combinations based on user input.

The project has helped over 50 people set up their own visualizer systems, building a small community where users support each other.

## 📜 Research Project
- Developed a **context-specific stress prediction system** using non-intrusive behavioral data (mouse activity, keystrokes, screen usage).
- This approach **outperformed webcam-based detection methods by 30%**, especially for users who wear glasses.
- Demonstrated how **daily digital behavior** can reflect mental health states in real time.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
I have 3 years of professional experience as a **Backend Developer** at PwC (Advisory Technology) and also worked as a **Full Stack Developer** at Digital Aptech.
